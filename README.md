Welcome GitHub user, to my personal project called oogway.
  
In my conviction, each computer scientist with a basic sense of philosophy and a respect for the history of scientific understanding, must at least once in his lifetime read 'The Imitation Game' and set out to build his/her own Turing Machine. Simple it may be; blended with ones personal taste of aesthetics, humor and technologies you can rise above yourself and design your own artificial intelligence. For no particular reason, simply because you can.

Not doing so is like a mathematician who, having the intellectual tool set to do so, has never created his own proof of Pythagoras' Theorem on right triangles. Or an engineer in robotics who in his humble life has never built his own robot. A physicist without a prism at home, or one who has never at least attempted to find a flaw in Einstein's theory of relativity. An astronomer not seeking an unknown star through his old dusty telescope, a mountaineer who has never set out to climb the Everest, an Italian who does not know how to make a pizza, a triathlete who has not finished the famous race on Hawa√Ø, a Muslim who has has always dreamed of Mecca but never fulfilled his religious duty of Hajj, a yogi afraid to do Sirsasana, etcetera, etcetera. You get the point. You miss a great chance, a great opportunity. Your life will not be complete before you take up the challenge. You have the skill set but fail to comprehend the main historical barriers mankind has taken in your particular field of interest. And how much fun it is to step in the food steps of our genius ancestors!!!

Thus, engineers, computer scientists, software developers, programmers and hackers, please check out this code and run this modest Turing Machine. Modest, as it is bound to fail the original test. Yet, fortunately, it was good fun building it.

This is what you need to do:

Elastic is used to create a simple knowledge base with (borrowed) wisdom, referred to here as 'the Oracle'. Go here https://www.elastic.co/ and install Elastic(Search) on your computer. I'm using version 2.4.4 and it runs fine. Define a cluster named 'oogway-cluster'. To simply test it you can leave default values for all other configurations.

Through ActiveMQ the different micro-services communicate. Go here http://activemq.apache.org/ and install ActiveMQ on your computer. Version 5.14.5. should do. No need to configure anything. Just run it.

Now check out this code. It being a micro-services architecture, you first need to run the RegistrationServer before you can run SannyasinServer and WebServer. 

Disclaimer :)	
Inspecting the project you will notice strange or at least uncommon words throughout the code ('Sannyasin' instead of 'Worker', 'Manager' instead of 'WorkerEngine'). This being a hobby project, I have used the lack of supervision to take a few coding short cuts, and have been excessively creative in choosing class, method and variable names. Don't try this at home when you're creating real life production software (all though this code runs quite successfully in production too: <url>) and please stick to the commonly used patterns and naming conventions to ease your colleagues' professional life.

I am grateful to people who post informative code examples on GitHub, to the ones who write useful blog posts, those who help others to transcend their technical struggles through stackoverflow, and of course the whole community of anonymous beings working diligently on great and useful open source projects.

If you have any ideas or suggestions for future improvements, or problems running this software, please comment and I will try to add new features. In case you want to personally contribute to the code, that of course is possible too.

Thank you for reading this and have a nice day.
